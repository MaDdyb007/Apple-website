<td class="info"><p>
The MacBook Air is a line of laptop computers developed and manufactured by Apple Inc. <br><br>
It consists of a full-size keyboard, a machined aluminum case, and a thin light structure. <br><br>
The Air is available with a screen size of (measured diagonally) 13.3-inch (33.782 cm), with different specifications produced by Apple.<br><br> 
Since 2010, all MacBook Air models have used solid-state drive storage and Intel Core i5 or i7 CPUs.<br><br>
 A MacBook Air with an 11.6-inch (29.46 cm) screen was made available in 2010.<br><br>
In the current product line, the MacBook Air sits below the performance-range of the MacBook Pro and compared to the MacBook, its features reflect different priorities.<br><br> 
The Air was originally released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the previous MacBook.<br><br>
 Since then, the Air has become Apple's entry-level laptop due to the MacBook's discontinuation in 2011, as well as lowered prices on subsequent iterations.<br><br>
The MacBook Air features an anti-glare LED backlit display and a full-size keyboard, as well as a large trackpad that responds to multi-touch gestures such as pinching, swiping, and rotating.<br><br>
 Since the release of Snow Leopard, the Air's trackpad has supported handwriting recognition.<br><br>
On October 30, 2018, Apple unveiled a redesigned 13.3" MacBook Air model, with a Retina display, Touch ID, two combination USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, and available in three colors (silver, space gray, and gold).<br><br>
 It began shipping the day of the event and was available in-store on November 7.<br><br>
 Unlike the previous generation, this model cannot be configured with an Intel Core i7 processor, the reason for this is currently unknown.
