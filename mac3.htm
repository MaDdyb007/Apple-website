<td class="info"><p>
The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc.<br>
It is the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently available in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes.<br>
 A 17-inch version was available between April 2006 and June 2012.<br>
The first generation MacBook Pro is externally similar to the PowerBook G4 it replaces, but uses Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips.<br> 
The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April. Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later 2006.<br>
The product's second iteration, known as the "unibody" model, has a casing made from a single piece of aluminum.<br> 
It debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. In January 2009, the 17-inch model was updated with the same unibody design. <br>
Subsequent updates brought upgraded Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt technology.<br>
Apple released the third generation of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. <br>
The previous generation 13- and 15-inch unibody models continued to sell with updated processors.<br>
 The third generation model is thinner than its predecessor and is the first to include a high-resolution Retina Display.<br> A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012
